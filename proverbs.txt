Practice makes perfect.
No pain, no gain.
You reap what you sow.
Many hands make light work.
Hard work pays off.
Rome wasn’t built in a day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
A little effort goes a long way.
Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Well begun is half done.
Better safe than sorry.
Look before you leap.
Think before you act.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Measure twice, cut once.
Easy come, easy go.
Curiosity killed the cat.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.
Honesty is the best policy.
Actions speak louder than words.
What goes around comes around.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
The truth will come out.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Don’t make promises you can’t keep.
Practice what you preach.
What is right is not always popular.
Better to give than to receive.
Health is wealth.
Time is money.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
The early bird catches the worm.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
Life is short, make it sweet.
Count your blessings.
All that glitters is not gold.
Fortune favors the brave.
Birds of a feather flock together.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
Two heads are better than one.
Good friends are like stars.
Don’t judge a man until you’ve walked a mile in his shoes.
Actions speak louder than words.
It takes two to tango.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Don’t burn your bridges.
Laughter is the best medicine.
